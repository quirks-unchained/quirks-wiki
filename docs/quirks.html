            <strong>Quirks</strong> are superhuman powers. 
            In this mod, they come in the form of a set of abilities which can be activated using the keys:
            <ul>
                <li><em>Z</em> - Ability Slot 1</li>
                <li><em>X</em> - Ability Slot 2</li>
                <li><em>C</em> - Ability Slot 3</li>
                <li><em>V</em> - Ability Slot 4</li>
                <li><em>H</em> - Toggle Slot (Passive)</li>
            </ul>
            At first, your <strong>quirk</strong> will only have 1 ability, but as you level up you can unlock more.
            You can equip each ability to a move slot through the <strong>Moves</strong> menu, accessed my pressing <em>M</em> to view your <strong>Player Card</strong> and then clicking the <strong>Moves</strong> button.
        </p>
